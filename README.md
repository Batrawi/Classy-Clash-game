# Classy Clash 🎮  

Welcome to **Classy Clash**, a 2D top-down adventure game built in C++ using the raylib library! This project is the culmination of my journey through the *C++ Fundamentals: Learn Game Programming For Beginners* course by GameDev.tv. It represents my first steps into game development and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## 🚀 About the Game  

In **Classy Clash**, players navigate through a captivating island filled with obstacles, enemies, and challenges. Armed with a sword, your objective is to survive relentless enemy attacks while exploring the terrain. This game combines smooth movement mechanics, responsive AI, and dynamic combat to deliver an exciting experience.

## 🎯 Features  

- **Player Movement:**  
   Navigate using WASD keys, with smooth and intuitive movement controls.  
- **Enemy AI:**  
   Enemies actively follow the player, creating a challenging gameplay experience.  
- **Combat System:**  
   Engage in sword combat with enemies using responsive collision detection.  
- **Physics & Collision Handling:**  
   Built with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) to manage realistic collisions with props, enemies, and boundaries.  
- **State-Based Animations:**  
   Dynamic animations for actions like walking and attacking, enhancing visual feedback.

## 🛠️ Development Insights  

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
This project marks my first use of OOP in game development, focusing on class hierarchies and encapsulation. Key classes include:  
- **BaseCharacter:** A base class containing shared functionality for all characters.  
- **Character:** Represents the player, including movement and combat actions.  
- **Enemy:** Defines enemy behavior, including movement and interaction with the player.  

### **Game Mechanics:**  
- **Physics & Collision:**  
   - Implemented using AABB for detecting overlaps between objects.  
   - Ensures smooth interactions with environmental props and boundaries.  
- **Combat:**  
   - Players can attack enemies using collision checks.  
   - Enemies are programmed to chase the player, adding a layer of strategy.  

### **Animation:**  
- Sprite animations bring characters to life by cycling through frames.  
- State-driven animations provide feedback based on the player's actions.

## ✨ Why This Project Matters  

Developing **Classy Clash** was a transformative experience, allowing me to dive into the world of game development and build a solid foundation in C++. It was my first time structuring a project with OOP principles, and I’m excited to take this knowledge further into projects involving Unreal Engine, DirectX, and more.
